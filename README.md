# System Transparency Provisioning Tool


We're currently trying out commitlint.  See [proposal](https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/project/documentation/-/blob/main/proposals/2023-01-19-commitlint-proposal.md?ref_type=heads).

Note that commitlint runs in our CI pipelines.  Installing commitlint locally is optional.
