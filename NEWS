NEWS for stprov v0.3.X

    This release mainly improves documentation, test coverage, and fixes bugs.
    There are a few minor features added relating to the stprov command-line UI.

    Incompatible changes

    * The -b option no longer accepts interface names that contain comma.

    Security fixes:

    * The -a option in stprov remote-run accepts addresses in CIDR notation,
      but falls back on /32 if an address omits the subnet mask.  The same
      subnet mask was used for IPv6, resulting in a much larger subnet.  This
      issue has been fixed, such that the default IPv6 subnet-mask is /128.

    Bug fixes

    * Produce host configurations that are compatible with stboot (stprov and
      stboot diverged on how to handle empty values, which has now been fixed).
    * Correctly set the host configuration fields "bonding_mode" and
      "bond_name".  The bonded interface name is always set to "bond0".
    * Add a Makefile option for setting custom OS-package URLs.  The
      built-in default used to be hardcoded without a good way of changing it.
    * Read TLS roots from a location that is consistent with stboot.  The
      consulted location is "/etc/trust_policy/tls_roots.pem".
    * Several nits and confusions in the stprov usage message were fixed.

    New features:

    * Options with multiple values can be specified as a comma-separated
      list (-e val,val) and/or by repeating the option (-e val -e val).  This
      makes the UX consistent for the -a, -b, and other multi-value options.
    * The -r option can accept multiple OS-package URLs.
    * The -d option can accept multiple DNS servers.  The built-in default
      has as a result also been updated to include Quad9's secondary server.

    Miscellaneous:

    * System documentation has been added, see docs/stprov-system.md.
    * Usage manual has been added, see docs/stprov-manual.md.
    * The OS package URL (-r) and user/password (-u/-p) options are no longer
      mutually exclusive.  The user and password options are instead silently
      ignored for OS package URLs without the "user:password" pattern.
    * The host configuration fields "authentication" and "identity" were
      removed.  So, the dummy "foo" and "bar" values are no longer written.
      Note that stprov never supported any real use of the removed fields.
    * The host configuration field "timestamp" was removed.  In other words,
      the platform's host configuration no longer indicates a provisioning date.
    * Major improvements to the QEMU test coverage, see integration/qemu.sh.

NEWS for stprov v0.2.1

    Other than improved documentation and testing, this release brings a few
    user-experience improvements such as santity-checking OS package URLs.

    New features:

    * Make a HEAD request on the specified OS package URL to see if it works

    Enhancements:

    * More intuitive hostname default value (no longer a domain name)
    * Add qemu-based integration test
    * Run tests and commitlint in CI for every commit
    * Add documentation, including MAINTAINERS, README, RELEASES, and NEWS
    * Minor internal refactoring

    Bug fixes:

    * Fix default bonding mode name
    * Fix broken and racy unit tests
    * Fix license copyright and list of authors

    Breaking changes:

    * None

    This release has been tested to work with:

    * stboot in provison mode (trust policy fetch-method set to "network")
      https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/core/stboot/, tag v0.2.1

    Use the following reference specifications to be interoperable with stprov:

    * EFI-NVRAM host configuration
      https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/project/docs/-/blob/main/content/docs/reference/host_configuration.md,
      commit-id 3f46dd067931b9023984052cc5b98ff6d0ed0a28

    We list additional reference specifications here as they become available.
