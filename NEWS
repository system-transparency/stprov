NEWS for stprov v0.5.4

    This release most notably helps operators provision Secure Boot keys.

    New features:

    * Secure Boot policy objects PK, KEK, db, and dbx can be provisioned.  See
      stprov-manual and stprov-system, which also links to a few HOW-TO guides.
    * It is optional to provide a file with with X.509 certificate roots for
      HTTPS.  If omitted, HEAD requests on HTTPS URLs will definitely fail.

    Miscellaneous:

    * Add INFO prints that clarify if the stprov commands succeeded or not.
    * Add INFO prints that clarify what is being provisioned in EFI NVRAM.

    Incompatible changes:

    * This version requires go version 1.23 or later when building.

    This release has been tested to work with:

    * stboot's provision mode, pre-release tag v0.6.2.
      https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/core/stboot/-/tree/v0.6.2
    * ISO building using stmgr, pre-release tag v0.6.4.
      https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/core/stmgr/-/tree/v0.6.4

    This release implements the specifications at:

    * https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/core/stprov/-/blob/v0.5.4/docs/stprov-system.md
    * https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/core/stprov/-/blob/v0.5.4/docs/stprov-manual.md#files-and-directories
    * https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/project/docs/-/tree/v0.5.2/content/docs/reference

NEWS for stprov v0.4.2

    Bug fixes:

    * Without -h and -H, use default hostname, e.g.,
      "localhost.local", without prepending an extra dot.

    New features:

    * For network autoselect (-A), prefer the fastest network interface.

    * Log the IP addresses used for the OS package HEAD request.

    * Populate the new host config description field with stprov version
      and timestamp, e.g.,
        "stprov version v0.4.0-13-g50ea7c2; timestamp 2025-01-30T13:49:01Z"
      This is the successor of the timestamp field, that was removed
      in v0.3.5.

    Incompatible changes:

    * This version requires go version 1.22 or later when building.

    This release implements the specifications at
    https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/project/docs/-/tree/v0.4.1/content/docs/reference

    This release has been tested to work with:

    * stboot's provision mode, release tag v0.5.2:
      https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/core/stboot/-/tree/v0.5.2
    * ISO building using stmgr, pre-release tag v0.5.0:
      https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/core/stmgr/-/tree/v0.5.0

NEWS for stprov v0.3.9

    This release fixes two bugs during stprov's network setup.

    Bug fixes

    * Skip network interfaces without MAC addresses during autoselect.
    * Ensure the selected network interface is in state UP before doing a
      one-off HTTP HEAD request on the OS package URL.  This fixes a bug where
      stprov sometimes fails to santity-check the OS package URL, in particular
      when there's no DNS resolution which masks temporary errors with retries.

    This release implements the following specifications:

    * The system documentation in this repository (docs/stprov-system.md)
    * https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/project/docs/-/blob/v0.3.0/content/docs/reference/efi-variables.md
    * https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/project/docs/-/blob/v0.3.0/content/docs/reference/host_configuration.md
    * https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/project/docs/-/blob/v0.3.0/content/docs/reference/trust_policy.md

    This release has been tested to work with:

    * stboot's provision mode, release tag v0.4.2:
      https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/core/stboot/-/tree/v0.4.2
    * ISO building using stmgr, pre-release tag v0.4.0:
      https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/core/stmgr/-/tree/v0.4.0

NEWS for stprov v0.3.5

    This release mainly improves documentation, test coverage, and fixes bugs.
    There are a few minor features added relating to the stprov command-line UI,
    and a little bit of clean-up as summarized in the miscellaneous section.

    Incompatible changes

    * The -b option no longer accepts interface names that contain comma.

    Security fixes:

    * The -a option in stprov remote-run accepts addresses in CIDR notation,
      but falls back on /32 if an address omits the subnet mask.  The same
      subnet mask was used for IPv6, resulting in a much larger subnet.  This
      issue has been fixed, such that the default IPv6 subnet-mask is /128.

    Bug fixes

    * Produce host configurations that are compatible with stboot (stprov and
      stboot diverged on how to handle empty values, which has now been fixed).
    * Correctly set the host configuration fields "bonding_mode" and
      "bond_name".  The bonded interface name is always set to "bond0".
    * Add a Makefile option for setting custom OS-package URLs.  The
      built-in default used to be hardcoded without a good way of changing it.
    * Read TLS roots from a location that is consistent with stboot.  The
      consulted location is "/etc/trust_policy/tls_roots.pem".
    * Several nits and confusions in the stprov usage message were fixed.

    New features:

    * Options with multiple values can be specified as a comma-separated
      list (-e val,val) and/or by repeating the option (-e val -e val).  This
      makes the UX consistent for the -a, -b, and other multi-value options.
    * The -r option can accept multiple OS-package URLs.
    * The -d option can accept multiple DNS servers.  The built-in default
      has as a result also been updated to include Quad9's secondary server.
    
    New documentation:

    * System documentation has been added, see docs/stprov-system.md.
    * Usage manual has been added, see docs/stprov-manual.md.

    Miscellaneous:

    * The OS package URL (-r) and user/password (-u/-p) options are no longer
      mutually exclusive.  The user and password options are instead silently
      ignored for OS package URLs without the "user:password" pattern.
    * The host configuration fields "authentication" and "identity" were
      removed.  So, the dummy "foo" and "bar" values are no longer written.
      Note that stprov never supported any real use of the removed fields.
    * The host configuration field "timestamp" was removed.  In other words,
      the platform's host configuration no longer indicates a provisioning date.
    * Failing HEAD requests on OS package URLs are treated as errors rather
      than warnings.  This behavior can be overridden with the force flag (-f).
    * Major improvements to the QEMU test coverage, see integration/qemu.sh.

    This release implements the following specifications:

    * The system documentation in this repository (docs/stprov-system.md)
    * https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/project/docs/-/blob/v0.2.0/content/docs/reference/efi-variables.md
    * https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/project/docs/-/blob/v0.2.0/content/docs/reference/host_configuration.md
    * https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/project/docs/-/blob/v0.2.0/content/docs/reference/trust_policy.md

    This release has been tested to work with:

    * stboot's provision mode, release tag v0.3.6:
      https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/core/stboot/-/tree/v0.3.6
    * ISO building using stmgr, pre-release tag v0.3.2:

    user-experience improvements such as santity-checking OS package URLs.

    New features:

    * stboot in provison mode (trust policy fetch-method set to "network")
      https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/core/stboot/, tag v0.2.1

    Use the following reference specifications to be interoperable with stprov:

    * EFI-NVRAM host configuration
